### The steps I took in setting up my development environment are as follows;
1. I opened and accessed Remix ID on my browser.
2. I then navigated to the file explorer from the Remix ID interface.
3. I clicked on the workspace actions and selected 'create blank'.
4. I then created a new workspace and named it [MyFirstSmartContract] ().
5. Within the workspace [MyFirstSmartContract] (), I created a new file with .sol extension and named it [SimpleStorage.sol] () to complete the set up of my development environment.

### After the development environment was all set and done, I wasted no time as I was eager to write my fist smart contract. 
I clicked on the [SimpleStorage.sol] () file in the workspace within which I started writing by;
1. Typed ```// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT``` to represent my contract license.
2. I then typed ```pragma solidity ^0.8.25;``` to specify the compiler version to be used in compiling my code.
3. I then declared my contract typing ```contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public favoriteNumber;
}```
4. I compiled the contract by selecting the [solidity compiler symbol] from the side bar and clicked on the compile button. After that action, I noticed a green chek markedâœ… on the compiler symbol to indicate successful compilation of the contract.
5. The deployment of the contract was also done by selecting the [deploy and run transactions] () symbol from the side bar and clicked on the deploy button to successfully deployed the contract.

### The challenge I faced was how to push the work to my GitHub repository.
I was able to overcome the challenge by the assistance of Mr. Likem via WhatsApp, with the aid of a video made by Sahabia and some videos on YouTube.
